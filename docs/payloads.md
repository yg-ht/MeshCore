# Payload Format

Inside each [MeshCore Packet](./packet_format.md) is a payload, identified by the payload type in the packet header. The types of payloads are:

* Node advertisement.
* Acknowledgment.
* Returned path.
* Request (destination/source hashes + MAC).
* Response to REQ or ANON_REQ.
* Plain text message.
* Anonymous request.
* Group text message (unverified).
* Group datagram (unverified).
* Multi-part packet
* Control data packet
* Custom packet (raw bytes, custom encryption).

This document defines the structure of each of these payload types.

NOTE: all 16 and 32-bit integer fields are Little Endian.

## Important concepts:

* Node hash: the first byte of the node's public key

# Node advertisement
This kind of payload notifies receivers that a node exists, and gives information about the node

# Acknowledgement

An acknowledgement that a message was received. Note that for returned path messages, an acknowledgement can be sent in the "extra" payload (see [Returned Path](#returned-path)) instead of as a separate acknowledgement packet. CLI commands do not cause acknowledgement responses, neither discrete nor extra.

# Group text message

The plaintext contained in the ciphertext matches the format described in [plain text message](#plain-text-message). Specifically, it consists of a four byte timestamp, a flags byte, and the message. The flags byte will generally be `0x00` because it is a "plain text message". The message will be of the form `<sender name>: <message body>` (eg., `user123: I'm on my way`).

# Group datagram

| Field        | Size (bytes)    | Description                                  |

| cipher MAC   | 2               | MAC for encrypted data in next field         |
| ciphertext   | rest of payload | encrypted data, see below for details        |

The data contained in the ciphertext uses the format below:

| Field     | Size (bytes)    | Description                                              |
|-----------|-----------------|----------------------------------------------------------|

| data len  | 1               | byte length of data                                      |
| data      | rest of payload | (depends on data type)                                   |

## Repeater authenticated time sync

Repeater firmware can optionally consume authenticated time announcements from one configured group channel. Public/group channel authentication only proves knowledge of the channel secret; it does not prove which station wrote the displayed sender name. Time-sync messages therefore require an Ed25519 signature from the pinned authority public key configured on the repeater.

`Tv1` is carried only as a binary group datagram. The earlier text-message shape is not used because a visible text message plus an Ed25519 signature does not fit the practical group-channel payload budget.

### Binary datagram

The group datagram `data type` is `0x0121`. Its data bytes are:

| Field        | Size              | Description                                  |
|--------------|-------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| marker       | 3                 | ASCII `Tv1`, exact case-sensitive marker    |
| timestamp    | 4                 | little-endian unsigned Unix timestamp        |
| sequence     | 2                 | little-endian unsigned 16-bit sequence       |
| name length  | 1                 | byte length of display name                  |
| display name | variable          | exact configured display name                |
| signature    | 64                | raw Ed25519 signature                        |

The configured time-sync display name is limited to 20 bytes. With that limit, the `Tv1` data field is at most 94 bytes before the group-datagram type and length header.

### Canonical signed bytes

The signature covers this ASCII byte string, including the final newline:

```text
MeshCore-Time-v1
<channel-id-hex>
<display-name>
<unix-seconds>
<sequence>
```

`channel-id-hex` is the lowercase hexadecimal SHA-256 digest of the configured raw 16-byte MeshCore group channel secret. It is used instead of the one-byte MeshCore channel hash so signatures are bound to a collision-resistant channel identity. The display name is an exact case-sensitive filter and is not an authentication control.

### Clock and replay policy

Repeaters only move the clock forwards after signature verification succeeds. Timestamps below the firmware fallback epoch or above the supported upper bound are rejected. Once the clock is initialised, a forward jump greater than `time_sync.max_forward_step` is rejected. Replay state is kept in RAM as the last accepted timestamp and sequence; it is not written to flash for every received message. A newer timestamp is allowed even when the 16-bit sequence has wrapped or restarted, while equal timestamps are rejected and non-advancing equal-timestamp sequences are counted as replay. After reboot, the forward-only clock check still limits replay when a valid RTC value is retained.

### Threat model

The configured public channel is only a transport. A valid channel MAC, matching display name, or matching diagnostic fingerprint is not sender authentication. The Ed25519 signature made by the configured full 32-byte public key is the authentication control. The receiver never trusts a public key supplied in a time message.

### Test vector

This vector uses a test-only keypair and the hashtag channel `#time`.
